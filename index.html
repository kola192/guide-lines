                <p class="text">As important as Social Media is for your business, a website shapes the online perception and messaging of your business
                in a way that social media cannot provide. A well put together, professional website will clearly outline the products
                or services you provide, and it gives your customer a better idea of what your business stands for. Here are five
                reasons why your business needs a website for the new year:</p>
                
                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">1. Having a Website can Attract New Potential Clients</h3>

                <p class="text">A website will enable customers to see what your brand is about while learning about your products and/or services. By
                having your website available to new and existing clients, it allows your business to be available 24/7. This means
                sales and bookings can be made at all hours of the day.</p>

                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">2. Adds Credibility to Your Business</h3>

                <p class="text">Having a website will immediately improve the credibility of your business. It can promote a strong impression to new
                and existing clients and showcases your skills to better position your business. Think of it as one of your primary
                tools for standing out from competitors.</p>

                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">3. You’re In Control</h3>

                <p class="text">Social Media is somewhat a rented space. You are always at the mercy of the latest social media update. Having a strong
                social following is great for credibility, but if that’s the only way your customers can find you, you lack any control.
                A website lets you tell your story your way and a true representation of your brand.</p>

                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">4. It is Inexpensive</h3>

                <p class="text">Creating a professional website can be an effortless process when you outsource the right team. It is also
                cost-effective to have a website for your business in comparison to other forms of advertising, e.g. Print or TV. The
                benefits of a website are that it is live 24/7 and you can make on-the-fly changes and update it to tailor it to your
                business needs.</p>

                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">5. Allows for Wider Reach</h3>

                <p class="text">Your website is accessible worldwide, allowing for increased exposure and sales due to an extensive demographic reach.</p>
             
                <p class="text">By considering these five practical reasons to create a website for your business in 2021, will allow your business to
                become even more successful. If you are looking to create a website, the Wise Up Marketing team can be sure to help you.

                <h3 class="sub-heading">step 1: get a domain name</h3>
                
                <p class="text">A domain name is your website’s unique address.
                
                It’s a good idea for businesses to have domain names that are the same as their business names (such as google.com).
                
                For example, the domain name for our website is funeermedia.com. For businesses, it’s important to think about
                how your domain will be relevant to what you do. It’s the first contact a lot of people will have with your site, so
                make it count.
                
                You will need to pay an initial cost to register your domain, and then pay a yearly fee to keep it registered going
                forwards. This means nobody else can take your domain!</p>

                <!-- sub-heading -->
                <h3 class="sub-heading">step 2: Create an Email Address</h3>

                <!-- demo-image -->
                <img src="images/email.png" alt="website" class="demo-img">

                <p class="text">To make your business look more professional and established, you’ll need a custom business email address. For example,
                yourname@yourbusiness.com instantly makes your business appear more established and credible than yourname@gmail.com.
                
                The most common format for business email addresses actually uses your business domain name.
                
                For example, our email address is info@websitebuilderexpert.com.</p>

                <!-- heading-4 -->
                <h4 class="heading4">what is hosting?</h4>

                <p class="text">In a nutshell, web hosting is the process of renting or buying space to house a website on the World Wide Web. Website
                content such as HTML, CSS, and images has to be housed on a server to be viewable online.</p>

                <p class="text">What exactly is a server? A server is a computer that connects other web users to your site from anywhere in the world.
                As the name implies, web hosting service providers have the servers, connectivity, and associated services to host
                websites. By offering a variety of hosting plans, they cover the spectrum of hosting needs, from small blogs and large
                organizations.</p>

                <p class="text">If you’re planning on creating an online presence, reliable web hosting is essential. There are literally hundreds of
                web hosts available today providing thousands of varieties of web hosting services. Plans range from free with limited
                options to expensive web hosting services specialized for business. The plan you choose will depend primarily on how you
                plan to use your website and how much you have budgeted for hosting.</p>

                <p class="text">Choosing the right hosting plan will mean having access to the right allocation of resources to keep your website
                loading quickly and reliably for your visitors. Think about how many businesses these days operate primarily online;
                their sales and business leads come from their website. If someone lands on a website and there's a problem — it takes
                too long to load or doesn't appear at all — potential customers won't wait around. They'll bounce off that site in
                search of a one that works correctly and can deliver what they are looking for, seamlessly.</p>

                <p class="text">If you’re new to operating a website, web hosting and related lingo can be a puzzling topic. Many a novice website owner
                has used the cheapest option or anything bundled with their domain name purchase under the mistaken belief that all
                hosting options are essentially the same.</p>

                <p class="text">This can be a costly mistake.</p>

                <p class="text">Here in Funeer Media we help you choose the right plan for you business.</p>
